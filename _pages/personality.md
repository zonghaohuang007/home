Soccer
=====
I have been crazy in soccer since I was in 9 years old. The first soccer game I watched was a prelimier league game: Chelsea vs Arsenal but after that I became a fan of Manchester United.

Cristiano Ronaldo is my idol, and his success encourages me to keep working hard every day.

Badminton
=====
Badminton is one of my favourite sports. I spent several hours per week in training when I was in Xiamen University, China, with those professional badminton players:
Dechao Hu, Xiaobin Chen, and Junwei Lu.

I am grateful for what they taught me in badminton skills.

RTS Games
=====
I also love watching RTS games including Starcraft 2 and Warcraft 3 but in fact I am not good at playing.

My favourite Starcraft 2 gamer is Classic, a protoss player from South Korea while my favourite Warcraft 3 gamer is Fly100%, a professional Chinese Orc player.
