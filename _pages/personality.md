Soccer
=====
I start to be interested in Soccer when I was in 9 years old. I remember the soccer game I watched for the first time was a prelimier league game: Chelsea vs Arsenal but after that I became a fan of Manchester United and a fan of Cristiano Ronaldo.

Now, I am crazy in soccer, and will never miss any important soccer game.

Badminton
=====
Badminton is one of my favourite sports. I spent several hours per week in training when I studied in Xiamen University, China, with those professional badminton players:
Dechao Hu, Xiaobin Chen, and Junwei Lu.

I am grateful for what they taught me in badminton.

RTS Games
=====
I also love watching RTS games including Starcraft 2 and Warcraft 3 but in fact I am not good at playing.

My favourite Starcraft 2 gamer is Classic, a protoss player from Korean while my favourite Warcraft 3 gamer is Fly100%, a professional Chinese Orc player.
