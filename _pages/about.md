I am currently a master student (by thesis) from School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, USA](https://go.okstate.edu/). Previously, I obtained a master's degree in Electronics (by coursework) from [Nanyang Technological University, Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx), and got my bachelor's degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from [Xiamen University, China](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/), in 2016 and 2015 respectively.

My research mainly focuses on trustworthy machine learning. My research goal is to design learning algorithms in terms of robustness, security, privacy, and fairness. Especially, I am interested in the theoretical aspects on applying differentialy privacy into machine learning.

I am currently doing my master thesis tittled by "Differentially Private ADMM For Privacy-Preserving Distributed Learning", and expected to graduate in Decemeber, 2019. I am highly motivated to pursue a PhD degree in my interested areas after finishing my master.
