My name is Zonghao Huang. I am currently a Ph.D. student at Department of Computer Science, [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu/). Previously, I did my undergraduate study in Electronic & Information Engineering at [Amoy University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/) (Xiamen University).

Generally, I am interested in the intersection of theoretical computer science, machine learning, and cryptography, with goals of designing provably secure and robust machine learning models.
