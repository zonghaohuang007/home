My name is Zonghao Huang. I am an incoming Ph.D. student at [Department of Computer Science, Duke University, USA](https://www.cs.duke.edu/). Previously, I received my B.Eng. degree in Electronic & Information Engineering at [Xiamen University, China](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/), also known as Amoy University, China.

I was previously an EE guy but my current research interests lie in CS area, especially theoretical CS. My previous research mainly focuses on trustworthy machine learning, specifically the theoretical aspects on applying differential privacy into distributed machine learning. I am currently interested in any problems within theoretical computer science such as cryptography.
