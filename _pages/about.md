My name is Zonghao Huang. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at [Department of Computer Science, Duke University](https://www.cs.duke.edu/), where I am fortunately advised by Prof. [Michael Reiter](https://reitermk.github.io/). Previously, I did my undergraduate study at Amoy University (Xiamen University).
