Hi, I am Zonghao Huang. Recently, I completed my master's study in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, US](https://go.okstate.edu/). I also hold a master's degree in Electronics awarded by [Nanyang Technological University, Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx). Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from [Amoy(Xiamen) University, China](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/).

My research mainly focuses on trustworthy machine learning. My research goal is to design learning algorithms in terms of robustness, security, privacy, and fairness. Especially, I am interested in the theoretical aspects on applying differentialy privacy into machine learning.
