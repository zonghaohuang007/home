I am currently a master student (by thesis) from School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [Oklahoma State University, USA]("https://go.okstate.edu/"). Previously, I obtained a master degree in Electronics (by coursework) from [Nanyang Technological University, Singapore]("https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx"), and got my bachelor degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from [Xiamen University, China]("https://en.xmu.edu.cn/"), in 2016 and 2015 respectively.

I am currently doing my master thesis, and expected to graduate in Decemeber, 2019. I hope I could continue my PhD pursuit in my interested area after finishing my master.

Research Interest
======
My work mainly focus on privacy and security issues in data analytics techniques. Especially, I am interested in the theoretical aspects on applying differentialy privacy into machine learning.
