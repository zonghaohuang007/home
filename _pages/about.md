My name is Zonghao Huang. I am currently a Ph.D. student at Department of Computer Science, [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu/). Previously, I received my B.Eng. degree in Electronic & Information Engineering at [Amoy University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/), also known as Xiamen University.

My previous research mainly focuses on the theoretical aspects of applying differential privacy into ADMM-based distributed machine learning. I am currently interested in the intersection of theoretical computer science, cryptography, algorithms and privacy.
