My name is Zonghao Huang. I am currently a Ph.D. student at Department of Computer Science, Duke University. Previously, I did my undergraduate study in Electronic & Information Engineering at Amoy University (Xiamen University).

Generally, I am interested in the intersection of theoretical computer science, machine learning, and cryptography. The goal of my research is to design provably secure and robust machine learning models and systems.
