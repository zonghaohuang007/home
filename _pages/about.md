My name is Zonghao Huang. Previously, I got my first master's degree in Electronics from [Nanyang Technological University, Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) in 2016 and my second master's degree in electrical and computer engineering from [Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, USA](https://go.okstate.edu/) in 2019. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from [Xiamen University, China](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/), in 2015.

My research mainly focuses on trustworthy machine learning. My research goal is to design learning algorithms in terms of robustness, security, privacy, and fairness. Especially, I am interested in the theoretical aspects on applying differentialy privacy into machine learning.
