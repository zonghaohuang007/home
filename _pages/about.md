My name is Zonghao Huang. Previously, I received my B.Eng. degree in Electronic & Information Engineering at [Xiamen University, China](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/), also known as Amoy University, China. I obtained my M.S. degree in Electronics from [Nanyang Technological University, Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) and M.S. degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering from [Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, USA](https://go.okstate.edu/), respectively.

As you can see, I am actually an EE guy but my research interests lie in CS area, especially theoretical CS. My previous research mainly focuses on trustworthy machine learning, especially the theoretical aspects on applying differential privacy into distributed machine learning. I am currently interested in any problems within theoretical computer science such as cryptography.
