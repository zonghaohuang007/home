Hi, I am Zonghao Huang. Previously, I pursued my B.E. degree in Electronic & Information Engineering at [Xiamen University, China](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/). I obtained my M.S. degree in Electronics awarded by [Nanyang Technological University, Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) and my M.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, U.S.](https://go.okstate.edu/), respectively.

My research mainly focuses on trustworthy machine learning. My research goal is to design learning algorithms in terms of robustness, security, privacy, and fairness. Especially, I am interested in the theoretical aspects on applying differentialy privacy into machine learning. In addition, I am interested in theoretical computer science.
