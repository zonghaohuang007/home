My name is Zonghao Huang. I am currently a Ph.D. student at [Department of Computer Science, Duke University](https://www.cs.duke.edu/), where I am fortunately advised by Prof. [Michael Reiter](https://reitermk.github.io/). Previously, I did my undergraduate study at Amoy University (Xiamen University). 

Generally, I am interested in the intersection of optimization, deep neural networks, cryptography, and computer security & privacy.
