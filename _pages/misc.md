* <b>Soccer:</b>
I have been crazy in soccer since I was 9 years old. The first soccer game I watched was a Prelimier League game: Chelsea vs Arsenal but after that I became a fan of Manchester United. Cristiano Ronaldo is my idol, and his great achievements encourage me to keep working hard every day.

* <b>Badminton:</b>
Badminton is one of my favourite sports. I spent several hours per week in training when I was with Xiamen University, under the supervision of some professional badminton players: Dechao Hu, Xiaobin Chen, and Junwei Lu. I am grateful for what they taught me in badminton skills.

* <b>RTS Games:</b>
I also love RTS games including Starcraft 2 (Protoss, MMR around 3700) and Warcraft 3. My favourite Starcraft 2 gamer is Classic, a protoss player from South Korea while my favourite Warcraft 3 gamer is Fly100%, a professional Chinese Orc player. <i>En Taro Classic! Gan Si Huang Xu-Dong!</i>
